I'm pretty into the whole privacy stuff. This means "de-googling" mobile devices and removing any proprietary services from the core function of the operating system if feasible. 

One of the methods to achieve this is replacing the Google Play Store with open source alternatives like F-Droid, or Aurora Store. The one problem here is that with a fragmented ecosystem comes a vary of user experiences.

Thus, I'm building yet-another-open-source-app-store and I found out there's a need to adopt a very decoupled architecture to achieve the goal. The "decoupled architecture" I've chosen is **clean architecture**.

Here are what I've learnt.
